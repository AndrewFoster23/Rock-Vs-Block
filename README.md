The infinite one is the finished game, the normal one was just a starting point

Rock Vs Block is a fun game I created based off of the mobile game "Snake vs Block", although mine rhymes

In this game, the player controls the snake made up of rock heads to grow and break through blocks

As time goes on, the block sizes and extra rock sizes increase, making the game more difficult

After the first 2 levels the rest of the game is randomly generated, and therefore different every time that you play

I hope that you enjoy one of my first pygame games ever!!
